# Dynamical Systems and Non-Linear dynamics using MATLAB.
There are examples of how to apply MATLAB in a mathematical approach, with the goal to study and analyze different dynamical systems, three codes are provided of different scenarios, 1-D System, 2-D Systems and 3-D Systems (Lorenz Equation). The variables and parameters can be changed, with the purpose to analyze the changes in the behavior of the system. 

The first code has the intention to simulate the dynamics of a one dimensional system, generating their phase portraits in different conditions, the bifurcations diagrams, etc. related to the biological background from which the model was generated. 

The second code has the intention to simulate the dynamics of a two dimensional system (The Holling-Tanner Model), of the predator-prey interactions. This code generates the phase portrait according to the initial conditions, and describes the dynamics of the model, related to the biological background from which the model was generated.

The third code has the intention to simulate the dynamics of a three dimensional system (Hastings and Powell Model), representing a 3-species food chain model with plants(x), herbivores (y) and carnivores (z). This code simulates the interactions of the system according to the initial conditions, and describes the dynamics of the model, related to the biological background from which the model was generated.

The three codes can be run on any computer with MATLAB and it is not necessary to generate any settings prior to running the code, the toolbox requirement to run the code. The code was developed with the R2023b version.
